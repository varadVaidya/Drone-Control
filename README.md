# Planar Quadcopter Control
## Aim
Aim of this project was to develop an 1-D and 2-D quadcopter model and use the basic control law such as PID to control the quadcopter to reach a certian desired setpoint and/or follow a planned trajectory.

## Results
### 1D Quadcopter
The quadcopter was constrianed to move only along the z-axis of the world frame. The quadcopter had to reach a certain desired setpoint which changed w.r.t time.
